In The Studio:
  [X] Remove the "Pop-Up Title" field
  [X] Change category headings to:
        Melodies
        Rhythms (currently beats)

  [ ] We have a new challenge with the "Related Genres" feature. Basically, we need to create a field holds up to three drop-down lists of the 23 genres. On the front end, visitors can touch a "Related Genre" and the interactive will relocate them to their selected genre's section. I'm not sure of the best solution for this on the back end, let's discuss it further as needed.
      - The Record Store Genres are as follows:
        Blues
        Country
        Folk
        Rhythm & Blues
        Soul
        Jazz
        Syncopated Instrumental
        Ragtime
        Classical
        Opera
